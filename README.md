### Hi there this is my about me READMEðŸ‘‹

My name is Johan Pirsch and i am interested in learning embedded systems programming to be able to work with DSP's and FPGA's at my current job. 

I currently work in Aerospace as an electrical engineer and would like to learn more about embedded C programming to apply my knowledge and skills to my job as well as any side projects i may have in the future involving FPGA's. 

My favorite hobbies include working out,solo traveling and playing the piano.
